The definitions which apply to these Terms and Conditions are set out in clause 19.

<strong>1 THE SERVICES</strong>
1.1 These Terms and Conditions will apply to any services or consumables that MEDILAB Laboratory Limited provides to the Client, unless those services are the subject of a separate written agreement signed by MEDILAB and the Client. These Terms and Conditions apply to the exclusion of any other terms presented by the Client or implied by custom or course of dealing.
1.2 By submitting a Pathology Request, a request for any other services described in the Laboratory Guide or in any other proposal provided by MEDILAB, or an order for any Consumables described in the Laboratory Guide (in each case an ‘Order’), the Client offers to purchase those Tests, other services or Consumables on these Terms and Conditions from MEDILAB. MEDILAB may accept or reject any Order.
1.3 A contract between MEDILAB and the Client for the provision of Services and / or Consumables, incorporating these Terms and Conditions and the Order (an ‘Agreement’) takes effect when MEDILAB confirms acceptance of the Client’s Order in writing, logs the relevant Pathology Request in its laboratory information management system, or begins performing the Services (whichever occurs first). Any request for add-on Tests (as described in the Laboratory Guide) constitutes a request for further Services under that Agreement, which MEDILAB may accept or decline. In the event of a conflict between the Order and these Terms and Conditions, the Terms and Conditions will take priority.
1.4 MEDILAB will provide the Services under the Agreement:
1.4.1 in accordance with Good Industry Practice;
1.4.2 in accordance with the UKAS medical laboratory accreditation standard (ISO 15189);and
1.4.3 using suitably skilled and experienced staff.
1.5 MEDILAB will use reasonable efforts to achieve the Test turnaround times quoted in the Laboratory Guide, but does not warrant that it will achieve those times in the case of any particular Sample.
1.6 The Laboratory Guide sets out Sample rejection criteria. If the Sample meets those criteria, or if MEDILAB considers that the Sample is otherwise unsuitable for Testing or MEDILAB is unable to conduct the Testing then MEDILAB may decline to carry out the Testing under the Agreement and will be entitled to dispose of the Sample.
1.7 MEDILAB may destroy or dispose of a Sample after completing the Testing or on termination of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Client.
1.8 In providing the Services, MEDILAB shall comply with all Applicable Law relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Corruption (Jersey) Law 2006. MEDILAB shall not, and shall ensure that its staff do not, engage in any activity which would constitute an offence under the Corruption (Jersey) Law 2006.
1.9 MEDILAB is committed to trading ethically, with zero tolerance for modern slavery (including forced labour or human trafficking of any kind), human rights violations, and child labour. In performing its obligations under this Agreement, MEDILAB will comply with all Applicable Law and applicable internal policies relating to anti-slavery and human trafficking.
1.10 MEDILAB laboratories may use external laboratories to undertake the Tests.

2.1 MEDILAB shall supply Consumables to the Client in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
2.2 The Consumables shall:
(i) be of satisfactory quality (within the meaning of the Supply of Goods and Services (Jersey) Law 2009) and fit for any purpose held out by MEDILAB; and
(ii) comply with all Applicable Law.
2.3 MEDILAB shall not be liable for Consumables’ failure to comply with clause if:
(i) the Client makes any further use of those Consumables after notifying MEDILAB of such failure;
(ii) the defect arises because the Client failed to follow MEDILAB instructions for the storage, use or maintenance of the Consumables or (if there are none) good practice regarding the same;
(iii) the Client alters or repairs those Consumables without MEDILAB’s prior written consent;
(iv) the defect arises as a result of fair wear and tear, deliberate damage, negligence, or abnormal storage or working conditions; or
(v) the Consumables differ from their description as a result of changes made to ensure they comply with Applicable Law.
2.4 In the event the Consumables do not comply with clause 2.2, MEDILAB shall provide replacement Consumables without undue delay. This shall be the Client’s only remedy for such non-compliance. The terms of this clause 2 shall apply to any such replacement Consumables provided by MEDILAB.
2.5 MEDILAB shall ensure that the Consumables are properly packed and secured in a manner to enable them to reach their destination in good condition, and in a manner which complies with Applicable Law.
2.6 If the Client or the Client’s carrier will collect the Consumables from MEDILAB premises, delivery shall be completed when MEDILAB places the Consumables at the Client’s disposal at MEDILAB premises. In all other cases, delivery shall be completed on the loading of the Consumables at the premises where they are loaded onto transport for carriage.
2.7 MEDILAB may deliver Consumables by instalments, which may be invoiced and paid for separately. Time for delivery of Consumables is not of the essence of this Agreement and delays in the delivery of Consumables shall not entitle the Client to refuse to take delivery.

When you visit MEDILAB website, with your permission we may send your computer a “cookie”. This is a small file that resides on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are small text files, which identify a user’s computer to our server. This does not mean we have access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. Also cookies in themselves cannot identify the individual user, just the computer used.

The MEDILAB website uses cookies to collect user information via a web analytics service provided by search engines. This allows us to evaluate, compile reports and help us to improve our website. For example, we can identify popular areas of the site so that over time we can tailor the information on our site to better meet the needs of our visitors. You can find out information on how to opt out of search engine Analytics cookies.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

<strong>How to control and delete cookies</strong>

MEDILAB will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you.

<strong>The importance of a cookie policy</strong>

Cookie policies are required by laws such as the GDPR and EU Cookie Law (otherwise known as the ePrivacy Directive). Furthermore, GDPR cookie consent to the cookie policy and the practices it outlines is also required by these EU laws.

While these laws are based in the EU, they apply to all businesses that market to EU consumers. This means that even UK and US businesses who operate outside of the EU, and who have EU customers need a dedicated cookie policy, that also meets the transparency and consent requirements of the Cookie Law.`
